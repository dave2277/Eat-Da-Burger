# Eat-Da-Burger

This application is designed to exhibit understanding of express routing in addition to using a templating engine.  The applicaiton is a fully functional (though rudimentary) example of full stack web development.  It encompassess handlebars, Grid CSS, Node express, and MySQL in addition to necessary middlewares including body-parser and method-override to enable PUT requests against a form.

From the user standpoint, one has the ability to enter the name of the most delicious hamburger he or she can think of.  Hitting submit initiates the post route logic to add the submission to the database.  Clicking the "Devour It" button underneath any of the entries will move the entry to the div on the right side of the burger, which contains a list of all the burgers which the user has 'Eaten.'

The applicaiton is availble for view on Heroku at:
